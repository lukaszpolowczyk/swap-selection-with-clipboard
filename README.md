## Features

### **How it work (descriptions):**

With Two Multiselection in code:  

* In the code, `Select a string`/`Point a word` - in **two places** with multiselection (`Alt+Select/Click`).
* Use `Alt+S` to swap these strings.

With One Selection in code and Clipboard:  

* In the code, `Select a string`/`Point a word` - in **one place**, without multiselection.
